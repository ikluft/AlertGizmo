# Nothing to see here. Move along.

The container built from this directory is just to configure and assemble software for building the AlertGizmo web site. Its purpose is so the programs don't have to be built from scratch every time the web site content is updated. The container is not intended for general use, and unlikely to be useful for any other purpose.
